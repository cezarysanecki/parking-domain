# Parking Domain - [contest 100 commits](https://100commitow.pl/)

Learning domain before implementation is the best choice that you can make.

Parking domain project is created to show how from naive and anemic model we can
evolve into better solution. Of course, I will try to do that! We will see if I can handle it. ðŸ˜Ž

This is just experiment for **educational purposes**. Of course, I will define MVP etc., but this domain is
not the goal in itself.

**Let jump into the code and see what will happen!**

## Used technologies (for now)

- [Java 21](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/)
- [Spring Boot 3](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  - Web
  - JPA
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [H2 database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)

## FAQ

### Is it production-ready?

Nope. For now, it is just conception. We will see where we will get with this. For sure, I will learn a lot.
I hope, you also!

### Why parking domain?

Do not know exactly... I tried to implement voting and vaccination domain, but writing ugly code (for education purposes)
discouraged me from them. I wrote about that on [my blog \[PL\]](https://cezarysanecki.pl/2024/02/13/prezentacja-prostej-domeny/).
I hope that coding anemic model for parking domain will not end like previous examples. And I heard about this domain in
one of the [DevMentors YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/@DevMentorsPL/videos)... and I think why not!

### Why Java and Spring?

Because it is my "native" background. And it is not my aim to learn new language. I want to learn how to model domain
having legacy code and learn tools from JVM ecosystem (but not only).

## MVP

- [ ] 3-layer app with anemic model (without tests)
  - [ ] Occupation logic
  - [ ] Reservation logic
  - [ ] Fee logic
- [ ] Refactoring to add unit tests
- [ ] Looking for deep model (modules)
- [ ] Add other types of requirements
  - [ ] Cleaning
  - [ ] Maintenance
  - [ ] Loyalty points
  - [ ] Customer recovery
- [ ] Add CQRS
- [ ] ...

## Business context

### Parking on parking spots

- Basic functionality for parking
- Parking is available 24/7
- Specified parking spot can be occupied (need to track them)
- Parking spots can be occupied by: cars, motorcycles, bikes and scooters
- To optimize occupation of parking spots assume that:
  - 1 parking spot can be occupied by **1 car**
  - 1 parking spot can be occupied by **2 motorcycles**
  - 1 parking spot can be occupied by **3 bicycles or scooters**
- We cannot mix vehicles types on one parking spot, unless they are in the same above group

### Cleaning parking spots

- Because parking is available 24/7, we cannot schedule a technical break to clean the spots
- We need to track when the spots were last cleaned and mark them as "out of order" when a specified period of time has passed since the last cleaning
- When 5 spots are marked for cleaning, we request the cleaning service

### Repair/Maintenance of parking spots

- Almost the same as cleaning parking spots
- It may not be as widespread as cleaning, but occasionally, we may need to change the parking surface
- Clients can report a malfunction or issue with a parking spot
  - They will receive loyalty points 
  - If they are given access to the broken spot, they should also be provided access to another parking spot from the emergency bank

### Fee

- Standard usage of parking spot:
  - 15 minutes - free
  - 1 hour - 5PLN
  - 2 hours - 9PLN
  - 4 hours - 17PLN
  - one day - 40PLN
  - each successive day - 50PLN
- Subscription:
  - dedicated spot bank
  - exclusive parking spot
  - monthly - 1000PLN
- Discount:
  - 1-10% for:
    - reporting issues
    - being loyal client (park for more than half of the days in a month)
    - recommendation

### Reservations

- Clients can reserve spot for one day
- Client can only have one reservation
- Clients reserve spots from main bank
- Reservations cannot exceed 50% of the available main bank

### Loyalty points

- Clients can receive loyalty points for reporting issues or being "long-term" client
- "Long-term" client is someone who park for more than half of the days in a month - 3 months in a row
- Loyalty points can be redeemed to receive gifts

### Customer recovery

- A customer labeled as 'difficult' has the right to assert their innocence
- If the verifier accepts the justification, a discount should be provided to that person as compensation

## Educational goals

I would like to learn the following technologies/tools. I need to consider which of them to use 
in the current project during the MVP phase. Certainly, I will create an anemic model using a 3-layer architecture.

- Very ugly 3-layer app (anemic models)
- Refactoring
  - Unit/Integration tests (Protect business logic) + TestContainers if needed
  - Change logic to add more unit tests
  - Split domains/hexagonal architecture
- Save form vs Save state per field
- Security (OAuth, SSL, CORS etc.)
- Event Sourcing
- Microservices
  - Service discovery
  - Circuit breaker
  - Tenants?
- Functional approach
- Kubernetes/Docker
- Kotlin
- Kafka
- Read Model/CQRS
- Slack notifications
- JOOQ
- Micronaut/Quarkus
- HotWire
- Observability
- Profiling
- Documentation
- Bi-temporal event
- jMeter
