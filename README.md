# Parking Domain - [contest 100 commits](https://100commitow.pl/)

> Choosing to learn about the domain before implementing is the optimal decision you can make.

The Parking Domain project aims to demonstrate the evolution from a rudimentary and limited model to a more
sophisticated solution.
I'm committed to undertaking this challenge and seeing if I can successfully navigate it. ðŸ˜Ž

This is just experiment which serves solely for **educational purposes**. While I will define the MVP and other
necessary aspects,
it's important to note that this domain is not the ultimate goal itself.

**Let jump into the code and see what will happen!**

## Used frameworks/libraries/tools

Main:

- [Java 21](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/)

## FAQ

### Is it production-ready?

Nope. At this stage, it's purely conceptual. We'll see where this experiment takes us. Undoubtedly, there's much to
learn along the way, for both of us!

### Why parking domain?

Don't know. I experimented with implementing the voting and vaccination domains, deliberately writing ugly code for
educational purposes. However, the outcome left me feeling discouraged. I've shared this experience
on [my blog \[PL\]](https://cezarysanecki.pl/2024/02/13/prezentacja-prostej-domeny/). I'm hopeful that coding an anemic
model for the parking domain won't result in the same challenges as my previous attempts. Interestingly, I came across
this domain in one of the [DevMentors YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@DevMentorsPL/videos), and I thought, "Why
not give it a try?"

### Why Java and Spring?

Because it's my "native" background, and my goal isn't to learn a new language. I aim to learn how to model a domain
with existing legacy code and explore tools from the JVM ecosystem (but not exclusively).

## Business context

### Parking

- Parking is available 24/7
- Parking spots have their own identity
- Parking spots are assigned to groups: BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD (attractiveness spot)
- Parking spots can be occupied (for now) by: cars, motorcycles and scooters
- Every parking spot has its own capacity (for now it is 4 units)
- On parking spot can park different combinations of vehicle types f.ex.
    - One vehicle (1 x 4)
    - Two motorcycles (2 x 2)
    - One motorcycles and two scooters (1 x 2 + 2 x 1)
    - Four scooters (4 x 1)

### Making reservation

- Reservation can only be made only for the next day
- Client can have only one valid reservation
- Client can make reservation for
    - any parking spot
        - from class (BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD)
        - for specified vehicle type
        - last until:
            - vehicle drives away
            - reservation time has expired
    - chosen parking spot
        - whole spot (can park even 4 scooters)
        - last until:
            - all vehicles drive away
            - reservation time has expired
- Making reservation on chosen parking spot is available for additional fee
- Reservations can be made, cancelled any time but 4-5am
- Reservation can be made for
    - morning (7:00-17:00)
    - evening (18:00-24:00)
    - whole day (7:00-24:00)
- Reservation can be extended to whole day
    - if was morning reservation
    - if current spot has no reservation for evening
- There is possibility to extended reservation choosing any free parking spot from the same class if current is reserved
- Reservations become effective for a given day during the reservation window (4-5am)

### Reservation fulfillment

- If reservation on any parking spot cannot be fulfilled
    - propose lower class spot with adding loyalty points
    - propose upper class spot for the same price
- If reservation on chosen parking spot cannot be fulfilled
    - propose
        - the same class spot
        - upper class spot
        - lower class spot with adding loyalty points
    - parking is for free

### Encourage to free reserved parking spot

- Clients who are on reserved chosen parking spot
    - notify them that they should free parking spot
    - give them discount for current parking

### Cleaning parking spots

> To be changed!

- Because parking is available 24/7, we cannot schedule a technical break to clean the spots
- We need to track when the spots were last cleaned and mark them as "out of order" when a specified period of time has
  passed since the last cleaning
- When 5 spots are marked for cleaning, we request the cleaning service

### Repair/Maintenance of parking spots

> To be changed!

- Almost the same as cleaning parking spots
- It may not be as widespread as cleaning, but occasionally, we may need to change the parking surface
- Clients can report a malfunction or issue with a parking spot
    - They will receive loyalty points
    - If they are given access to the broken spot, they should also be provided access to another parking spot from the
      emergency bank

### Fee

> To be changed!

- Standard usage of parking spot:
    - 15 minutes - free
    - 1 hour - 5PLN
    - 2 hours - 9PLN
    - 4 hours - 17PLN
    - one day - 40PLN
    - each successive day - 50PLN
- Subscription:
    - dedicated spot bank
    - exclusive parking spot
    - monthly - 1000PLN
- Discount:
    - 1-10% for:
        - reporting issues
        - being loyal client (park for more than half of the days in a month)
        - recommendation

### Loyalty points

> To be changed!

- Clients can receive loyalty points for reporting issues or being "long-term" client
- "Long-term" client is someone who park for more than half of the days in a month - 3 months in a row
- Loyalty points can be redeemed to receive gifts

### Customer recovery

> To be changed!

- A customer labeled as 'difficult' has the right to assert their innocence
- If the verifier accepts the justification, a discount should be provided to that person as compensation

## Event Storming session

### Registration new parking spot

![Registration new parking spot](/docs/public/es/es_registration_parking_spot.png)

There is possibility to register new parking spots in system f.ex. when we create new ones.
After registration, it lends in overall parking spots bank.

**Hot spot:** Need to consider if there is a need to provide parking spots for disabled people.

### Parking vehicle

![Parking vehicle](/docs/public/es/es_parking_vehicle.png)

Need to find available parking spot for specified vehicle type. If it fails we will try to find another one
up to 3 times (because one of them could vanish from bank just a moment ago). If there is success just assign
this parking spot to vehicle.

**Hot spot:** What if there would like to park huge vehicle which requires f.ex. 2 parking spots?
For now, we skip this case.

### Release parking spot

![Release parking spot](/docs/public/es/es_release_parking_spot_and_cleaning.png)

Simple scenario, if someone did not pay then there is refusal to release parking spot.
But if there was payment we put parking spot back to bank, add loyalty points to user and increase counter
responsible for parking spot's clearance. When parking spot clearance counter reach 5 then we mark this spot as needed
clearance. Of course, it is removed from available bank. When at least 10 parking spots and these spots are free
(there are no vehicles on it) we call external cleaning service. Unless it was already called.

After cleaning, parking spots go back to available bank, and we tick off that external clearance has been done.

### Reservation

![Reserve parking spot](/docs/public/es/es_reservation.png)

We can reserve parking spot for specified date f.ex. to go to cinema. There are two conditions: is any parking spot
available and client is marked as unwanted. If not we reject possibility to reserve spot.

**Hot spot:** Can we reserve more than one parking spot (group reservation)?

### Reservation

![Reserve parking spot](/docs/public/es/es_releasing_reserved_parking_spot.png)

2 hours before a reservation, we inform clients that they need to vacate their spot.
We reserve another parking spot for them. If a client notifies us that they've freed up the parking spot,
we reward them with loyalty points for their assistance. 1 hour before the reservation,
we check if the spot has been released. If not, we relocate the vehicles and charge the users of those vehicles.
If yes, we simply remove the parking spot from the available parking bank.

### Punishing client

![Punishing client](/docs/public/es/es_punishing_for_unused_reservation.png)

15 minutes after a reservation, we check if the client has not parked in the reserved spot.
If not, we add this spot to the available bank and notify the client. If this is the 2nd or 3rd warning,
we deduct loyalty points. If it's the 4th warning, we mark the client as unwanted.

## Educational goals

I would like to learn the following technologies/tools. I need to consider which of them to use
in the current project during the MVP phase. Certainly, I will create an anemic model using a 3-layer architecture.

- Very ugly 3-layer app (anemic models)
- Refactoring
    - Unit/Integration tests (Protect business logic) + TestContainers if needed
    - Change logic to add more unit tests
    - Split domains/hexagonal architecture
- Save form vs Save state per field
- Security (OAuth, SSL, CORS etc.)
- Event Sourcing
- Microservices
    - Service discovery
    - Circuit breaker
    - Tenants?
- Functional approach
- Kubernetes/Docker
- Kotlin
- Kafka
- Read Model/CQRS
- Slack notifications
- JOOQ
- Micronaut/Quarkus
- HotWire
- Observability
- Profiling
- Documentation
- Bi-temporal event
