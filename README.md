# Parking Domain - [contest 100 commits](https://100commitow.pl/)

Learning domain before implementation is the best choice that you can make.

Parking domain project is created to show how from naive and anemic model we can
evolve into better solution. Of course, I will try to do that! We will see if I can handle it. ðŸ˜Ž

This is just experiment for **educational purposes**. Of course, I will define MVP etc., but this domain is
not the goal in itself.

**Let jump into the code and see what will happen!**
